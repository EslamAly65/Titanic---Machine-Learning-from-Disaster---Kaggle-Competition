# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster---Kaggle-Competition

This is my submission file for the Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster Kaggle-Competition

The competition is about The sinking of the Titanic which is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

## Following this code I have:
- Gathered the data
- Cleaned the data 
- Split the data into train and test sets
- Applied several alogorithms to predict the sales
  
After that, I submitted the best result which granted me a score of 0.7799 based on accuracy.
